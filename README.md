# Ruby Capstone

## Description

In this project, we create a console app that helps you to keep a record of different types of things you won: books, music albums, movies, and games. Everything is based on the UML class diagram presented below. The data is stored in JSON files and we also prepare a database with tables structure analogical to our program's class structure.
